# hackathonProject
A software project for the UWW 2024 Hackathon!

## This repo:
1. Downloads the most recent CVE dataset
2. Processes the data to remove any edited or removed CVEs
3. Creates a smaller sample dataset to tokenize the descriptions

## In the future, this repo will:
1. Use clustering to decrease the number of tokens, making it easier and more efficient for an LLM to process
2. Act as an RAG
3. Support multiple LLMs
